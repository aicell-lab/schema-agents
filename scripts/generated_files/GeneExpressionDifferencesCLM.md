# Input Data Files

# Analysis Steps
Download gene expression count data (MTX format) for both CLM 01 and CLM 02 samples.
Perform data preprocessing to filter out low-quality genes and normalize the data.
Use dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) to visualize the data and identify clusters.
Perform differential gene expression analysis between clusters identified in CLM 01 and CLM 02.
Validate findings with additional data (e.g., tissue images) to correlate gene expression patterns with tissue morphology.
# Desired Output
Identification of unique cellular compositions or states based on differences in gene expression patterns between CLM 01 and CLM 02 samples.
