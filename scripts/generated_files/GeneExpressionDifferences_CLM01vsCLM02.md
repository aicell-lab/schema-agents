# Input Data Files

# Analysis Steps
1. Download gene expression count data (MTX format) for both CLM 01 and CLM 02 samples.
2. Perform data normalization and quality control on both datasets.
3. Use differential gene expression analysis tools (e.g., DESeq2, edgeR) to identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed between the two samples.
4. Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering) on the differentially expressed genes to identify unique cellular populations or states.
5. Visualize the results using tools like ggplot2 or Seurat.
# Desired Output
A report detailing the unique cellular populations or states identified through differential gene expression analysis between CLM 01 and CLM 02 samples, including visualizations of the results.
