# Identification of unique gene expression profiles in mononuclear phagocytes within human colo-rectal liver metastasis (CLM) samples can reveal clinically relevant markers for diagnosis and treatment.
1. Download and preprocess the dataset from GSE254364.
2. Perform spatial transcriptome analysis to identify gene expression profiles specific to mononuclear phagocytes in CLM samples.
3. Compare the identified gene expression profiles with known markers of mononuclear phagocytes to validate findings.
4. Use statistical analysis to determine the significance of the identified markers in the context of CLM.
5. Correlate the expression of identified markers with clinical outcomes to assess their relevance.
